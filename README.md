# Deep-Neural-Network-for-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-MNIST-

Description: Built and trained a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the MNIST dataset, demonstrating strong foundational knowledge in deep learning architecture design, training, and evaluation.

Preprocessed image data by scaling pixel values to [0,1] and splitting 60,000 samples into training (54,000) and validation (6,000) sets for robust evaluation.

Designed a Feed-Forward Neural Network with a Flatten input layer, two hidden dense layers (50 neurons each, ReLU activation), and a 10-class Softmax output layer.

Compiled the model with Adam optimizer and Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy loss, training over 5 epochs with a batch size of 100.

Evaluated model performance on 10,000 unseen test images, achieving 96.58% accuracy and 11% test loss, validating effective model generalization and performance.

Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow (tf.keras, tensorflow-datasets), NumPy
